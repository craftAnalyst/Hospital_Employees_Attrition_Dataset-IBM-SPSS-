# Building a Predictive Model Using Logistic Regression in IBM SPSS  

I built a predictive model using logistic regression in IBM SPSS with the primary goal of
forecasting employee attrition based on key independent predictors: educational field, marital
status, department, and gender. The aim was to identify the most significant factors influencing
attrition and provide actionable insights to optimize business strategies.  

For this analysis, I carefully selected an attrition dataset that contained relevant variables for
prediction. The key predictors included educational field, marital status, department, and gender.  

The data was cleaned to ensure accuracy: missing values were addressed through exclusion,
and outliers were identified and managed. Descriptive statistics were used to assess the
distribution of the data, ensuring it met the assumptions for logistic regression. The dependent
variable (attrition) was binary, coded as 0 (No) and 1 (Yes), with equal representation of both
classes to ensure a balanced and unbiased analysis. Independent variables were selected based
on their relevance to the business objective.  

The model achieved an accuracy of 77.1%, indicating a strong predictive performance. The p-
value was significant, confirming the model's validity, and the results further highlighted the
individual contributions of the independent variables to predicting attrition.
